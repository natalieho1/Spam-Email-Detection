# Natalie's Spam Email Classification Model 

A model that classifies whether or not an email is spam or ham (not-spam)! 

Trained on my own emails, I learned the hard way how to download emails, preprocess data, and how to build and train a model.  

## What I learned: 
* How to iterate, remove columns, and concatenate DataFrames
* The painful process of processing data... it's important to sort data into features and labels.
* It took me more time to figure out how to download the data, do it correctly, remove stopwords and punctuation, and balance the dataâ€”than it did to build and train the model.
* Maybe train the model before calling for a summary of the model! For the longest time the model output had question marks and zero parameters haha.
